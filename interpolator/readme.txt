To run the interpolation tests

1) comment in/out the moveTo that is needed to decide which pick location to use at line 70,71,72.
2) build and run linear.cpp

Files will be created containing relevant data.


OBS if error "buffer overflow detected" is present, then the path to the project is too long.
